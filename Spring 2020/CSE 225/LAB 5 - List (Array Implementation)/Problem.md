# Problem:

- Create a class named StudentInfo with properties: name, id and CGPA. This should also has a function to print the properties and getter functions. 

- Modify UnsortedType and SortedType classes so that they can be used with StudentInfo class. Put the modified codes under new classes and corresponding files. You should modify functions such that any search operations use student id to implement searching.
