### Problem description

- You have N magical bags of candies in front of you. It takes 
  you one minute to finish a bag of candies, no matter how many candies in
  it. Every time you finish a bag with X candies in it, the
  bag is magically replenished with X/2 (rounded down to
  the nearest integer) more candies. Write a program
  that determines the maximum number of candies you
  can eat in K minutes.
  
  The input is a sequence of integers. The first integer N
  is the number of bags. The next integer K is the number
  of minutes you have. The next N integers is the number
  of candies in the bags. The output of your program is a
  single integer which represents the maximum number
  of candies you can eat.
